INTRODUCTION:
------------

	     NOTE:  THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS ANY 1200 OR
		    2400 BPS MODEM INTENDED FOR AUTO-
		    DIALING WITH THE 'AT' PROTOCOL OR
		    THE RACAL-VADIC PROTOCOL. IT ALSO
		    SUPPORTS THE  PROMETHEUS PROMODEM
		    EXTENDED-'AT' 1200 BPS PROTOCOL.


	 NOTE:	IMP v245 adds break capability.  Use ESC Q.
		It also adds the 'TIG' toggle command to
		display all incoming control characters if
		needed for a remote editor.


	The IMP modem program enables a computer to communicate with
another computer.  This is normally done by using standard telephone
lines but with special audio tones sending serial data.  Three common
speeds are used, depending on the facilities available -- 300, 1200 or
2400 bps.  ('bps' stands for bits per second.  One character is 10 bits
normally.  It may be 11 bits if two stop pulses are used.)


WHAT IS A MODEM?
---------------
	A "modem" is provides these audio tones.  This is an acronym for
"modulator and demodulator".  The one section (modulator) provides the
audio tones for sending over the telephone line and the other section
(demodulator) then converts those audio tones back to digital pulses the
computer uses to receive the incoming data.

	The modem itself is a hardware utility, usually costing around
$50 to $125 for a typical 300 baud device and from $80 to $250 for a
system offering 1200 bps as well as 300 baud.	The newest modems add
2400 bps and currently can be obtained from $200 to "way on up".  (The
so-called "list prices" are rarely paid even with single-unit purchases.)

	Some modems are intended for plugging directly into the computer
while a vast majority used with CP/M computers are external devices that
attach to the computer through a serial I/O connector.	These are often
designed to sit under the phone itself to minimize the space required.
An external modem has several advantages as most have numerous indicator
lamps telling the user what is happening.  This also makes it far more
simple to use the modem on any of several computers the user may have.
(It also makes it a lot easier to adjust the loudspeaker volume control
than on an internal unit.)


AUTO-STEPDOWN, A NEW MODEM FEATURE
--------------------------------
	The newer 300/1200/2400 bps intelligent modems have the ability
to determine the maximum speed (baudrate) at which the system they are
calling can use.  They adjust themselves accordingly, without operator
intervention or knowledge.  They send a "result code" back to the local
computer telling it what speed they now have.  This information can be
used to automatically set the local computer to the same speed.  A mes-
sage is displayed telling the operator what speed he has.

	If the operator has a reason for using less than the maximum
speed to which another system might respond, he can initially restrict
the modem from attempting to connect at a faster speed.  Example, Compu-
serve has modems that will answer at either 1200 or 300 bps.  If reading
and answering messages "on line in real time" many callers prefer to use
300 baud (they cannot type even that fast) rather than 1200 bps which is
nearly twice the cost.	(They also have 2400 bps modems but those are
frequently on an independent phone line not used for 300 or 1200 bps.)

	IMP takes advantage of this automatic stepdown feature.  It has
the modem attempt to connect at 2400 bps.  If that is unavailable at the
answering end, the modem tries for 1200 bps.  When connected, IMP shows
the speed currently in use and automatically adjusts the local I/O to
match.	(IMP is the first and currently the only free modem program to
take advantage of this new modem feature.)

	The operator can easily select the "SET" command should he wish
to override the automatic "start trying at 2400" and have a specific
speed dialed (such as 300 baud for Compuserve for hand typing messages
at lower cost, etc.)  The automatic feature is reinstated by either
using the "SET" command for 2400, or merely calling up the modem program
from the disk once more.

	Note: The US Robotics Courier auto-steps from 2400 to 1200 but
not to 300, as do most of the other new modems with 2400 bps.  This is
no loss, really, as few people using 2400 would call into a system only
having 300 bps.


PURPOSE
-------
     The program discussed in this guide allows each computer involved
to directly control its own modem, converting DC pulses into audio tones
which are sent to (or received from) the telephone line.  (The standard
1200 baud transmissions use "DPSK" (dibit phase shift keying) instead of
"AFSK" (audio frequency shift keying).

     For short distances, no modems are required as the computer can
provide the necessary digital voltages.  This discussion is centered
around systems intended for use over distances ranging from several
miles to literally around the world.


FEATURES:
--------
     A program to communicate with another computer can range from very
simple to very complex.  Although IMP has a number of quite useful fea-
tures (some of which other modem programs do not currently offer) it is
one of the easier programs to learn and use.  A list of some of the
features offered by this particular program include:

  1)  Ability to talk with another computer via keyboard at each end.
	  (Called the "terminal mode".)
  2)  Ability to operate a remote mainframe computer such as TYM-SHAR,
	  or special data bank systems now commonplace.  This includes
	  "bulletin board" systems for receiving, sending or just read-
	  ing messges or other types of information.
  3)  Ability to upload (send) or download (receive) programs from other
	  computers whether TYM-SHAR, data banks, remote hobby systems
	  or just another individual in another location.
  4)  Ability to automatically transfer a group of files (called "batch
	  mode".  Two popular methods included, KMD batch mode and the
	  older MODEM7 batch mode.  (Only the KMD type is supported by
	  RCPM or RAS systems, the MODEM7 batch type can be used when
	  in contact with another individual that only has the MODEM7
	  type.)
  5)  Ability to copy incoming information on a printer.  If the print-
	  er is too slow to copy the data directly, the extra characters
	  back into a large storage buffer until they can be printed.
  6)  Ability to copy incoming data into memory for automatic transfer
	  to a disk file.
  7)  Accomodates any computer clock speed up to 25.5 MHz. in 0.1 Mhz.
	  increments for uniform results.  (The clock speed is actually
	  of modest interest, it is only used for setting timing loops.)
  8)  Advanced type of error detection (CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check)
	  using automatically generated high-speed lookup tables.
  9)  Ability to send any of 10 different pre-programmed function keys.
	  (These keys are very easy to reset, using either of two exter-
	  programs provided.)  An 11th key is available for log-on use.
 11)  Ability to send a 'break tone' to control mainframe reset and for
	  use with PC Pursuit to disable the '<ret> @ <ret>' disconnect.
	  This uses ESC Q, can be set otherwise in the overlay.
 10)  Automatic disconnect from the telephone line when using ESC N, "D"
	  or "Z" as an option during file transfer.
 11)  Automatic or manual 1k protocol for increased throughput and effi-
	  ciency over the 128 character blocks long associated with such
	  programs.  (Effectively gains 10% at 1200 bps and 20% if using
	  2400 bps.)
 12)  Supports 1200 or 2400 bps modems using the Racal-Vadic or 'AT'
	  protocol developed by Hayes.	These features basically include
	  automatic dialing and redialing until the system being called
	  finally answers.

	       a) Automatic selection of a particular phone number from
		  a library of names and numbers.  (These phone numbers
		  can be very easily changed by using either of two ex-
		  ternal programs that are provided.)
	       b) Automatic dialing for alternate long-distance systems
		  (where auto-dialing touch-tone modems are used).
	       c) Entry of a hand-typed number.  Although it might be as
		  simple to manually dial the number as hand-type it, it
		  can then be automatically redialed indefinitely.
	       d) Auto-linking of 1-32 different numbers for continuous
		  dialing until one of the group is available.
	       e) Choice of beeping continuously when connected to get
		  the operator's attention, or beep one time and go to
		  terminal mode immediately to catch UNIX or IBM signon
		  messages that assume you can copy when connected.
	       f) Automatically adjusts the terminal speed to that of
		  system answering the phone.


USING THE PROGRAM THE FIRST TIME:
--------------------------------
     For now, we shall assume the program is ready to use on your equip-
ment.  (Installing the appropriate overlay to achieve this result will
be discussed later.)


	  IMP v245 modem pgm (type M for Menu)
	  Copyright (c) 1985, 1987 Irvin M. Hoff
	  Version for Datapoint 1560 modem port 28H
	  Modem speed is: 2400 bps

	  B>>COMMAND: x


	(Your version would look different at line 3 once the
	appropriate overlay was added and the baudrate might
	show 1200 if you do not have 2400 bps available.)


       The cursor stops at point "x:" waiting for some sort of command.
Typing a "M" followed immediately by a RETURN, shows the first page of
a 3-page help guide.

     Several commands are similar to those already used for CP/M, such
as 'ERA', 'DIR' and the ability to change disk drives and user areas.
This adds tremendous flexibility while remaining in the modem command
mode.  To change disk drives, just say:

	  B>>COMMAND: A: <ret>

     and you are in the same user area on the A: drive.  You can also
     say:

	  A>>COMMAND: A12: <ret>

     to change user areas.  When finished (using this example), say:

	  A12>>COMMAND: CPM  <ret>
		 or
	  A12>>COMMAND: BYE  <ret>

     and you will go back to CP/M with the original drive and user area.


OPTIONS:
-------
     There are 6 primary options and 9 secondary options that may be
typed on the command line.  In addition there are other numerous commands
ranging from single character to three characters that can be used (such
as DIR, ERA, LOG, etc.)  Those are listed on the menu.

     Primary Options:	 E, L, M, R, S, T
	  E = Echo mode (special type of full duplex)
	  L = Local modem (no remote echo, half duplex)
	  M = Menu display showing features that are available
	  R = Receive a file from remote facility
	  S = Send a file to a remote facility
	  T = Terminal mode (full duplex, echo provived remotely)

     Secondary Options:  A, B, D, J, O, Q, R, S, V, X, Z
	  B = Batch mode -- allows automatic multiple file transfer
		Most RCPM systems now use KMD in place of the older
		XMODEM program.  KMD offers YMODEM-type batch mode.
		This can also simplfy single-file transfers since
		the filename only needs to be typed at one end.  It
		also permits using "wildcards" which makes it easier
		to type filenames.  Batch mode is also useful from
		modem-to-modem (as when talking to a friend, etc.).
	  D = Disconnect when done, stay in IMP
	  K = Manually initiates 1k protocol in send mode
	  Q = Quiet mode, special purpose feature rarely used except if
		 operating through a "BYE" program.
	  R = Receive remote file (8-bit binary)
	  S = Send file to remote system (8-bit binary)
	  V = Visual inspection of an ASCII file being transferred.  Not
		 often used as most ASCII files are now "crunched" for
		 minimum transfer time and disk space.
	  X = Inhibits automatic 1k request, transfers 128 char. blocks
	  Z = Exit to CP/M  when finished, disconnect from phone line


     Although you can get the following information from the help guide
in IMP itself, showing it here will allow us to discuss the various fea-
tures in somewhat better detail.

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE PAGE 1:
-------------------------------

     There are basically three types of commands that may be used with
this program:
	     1)  Single-letter commands shown on page one.
	     2)  Three-letter commands shown on page 2, and
	     3)  Control-<char.> commands shown on page 3.

     Going down the list:

  ? - shows current parameters.  As these are closely tied in with some
	  of the other options, we shall show a typical example later
	  in this discussion.
 ESC - shows the function key intercept character.  This may be easily
	  changed by selecting a different character at the 'EXTCHR'
	  option in the overlay.  (Byte 0114h.)

	  NOTE:  typing ESC <ret> while in the command mode will display
		 all the programmable function key definitions with the
		 exception of the log-on string which uses ESC L.

  M - shows the menu a page at a time.	You may abort after any page is
	  shown, with a CTL-C.
  E - terminal mode with echo.	When talking with another terminal also
	  also using IMP (or a comparable program), one of you must send
	  an 'echo' back so you can both see what the other person is
	  typing.  This is needed for full-duplex operation.  Usually
	  the person originating the call will type "E" instead of "T".
	  However either may do this.  If "both" use the echo mode, the
	  program usually starts typing a string of feedback characters
	  since both computers are re-sending the same character over
	  and over.  You can stop this by just returning to command mode
	  (type control-E) and then retyping "T" rather than "E".
  L - terminal mode with local echo.  Shows what you are typing but does
	  not send an echo of the other person's typing back to him.
	  Can be used at both ends, in place of one person using "E".
	  Both "E" and "L" are useful at times for some types of modems
	  that do not use full-duplex, or for some main frame units that
	  run half-duplex.  The combination of "T", "E" and "L" gives an
	  excellent choice to use on various systems.  Normally the "T"
	  mode is sufficient except when talking with another person and
	  then the "E" mode at one end or "L" mode at both ends will
	  provide normal results.  If the remote system does not supply
	  a LF after a CR, you can get that from the 'TLF' command.
  T - puts the program directly into "terminal mode", allowing it to
	  send from the keyboard to the other computer, and to copy any-
	  thing coming from the other computer with the exception of
	  file transfers (use "R" to receive those).
  R - used only for receiving files from the other computer.  These are
	  usually sent in binary form with either checksum verification
	  or more commonly, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking).  If ready
	  to receive another file, you have several choices, depending
	  on the program used by the other computer.   After notifying
	  him you are ready (or will be very shortly), you can type:

	       B>>COMMAND: R HELLO.DOC <ret>

	  and when he starts to send, you will receive the program which
	  then goes directly to the disk.  You could also have said:

	       B>>COMMAND: R <ret>	or   RB <ret>  if you prefer

	  This is called the "Batch mode" and is an extremely useful way
	  to receive programs automatically, from another computer using
	  a similar program.  He will use the batch mode for sending the
	  programs and that automatically provides the file names at the
	  receiving end.  In this manner, large numbers of programs can
	  be transferred completely automatically, including full disks.
	  (Assuming you care to pay the toll calls for the time it will
	  take!)

	  NOTE:  The method used to receive batch mode would be:

	       B>>COMMAND: R <ret>    (also RB <ret> may be used)

		 since you may not know in advance how many programs he
		 will be sending.

	       NOTE:  While receiving a file, any errors will be shown
		      on the console CRT, indicating that portion of the
		      program, if being repeated.  If the file finishes
		      transferring normally, it will have been received
		      error-free.  Those error notices are merely to let
		      the user know a momentary problem caused a resend.
		      The error messages indicate phone line quality.

  S - used only to send programs.  Similar to "R" but sends instead of
	  receives.  If the other system is ready to receive, you could
	  then type:

	       B>>COMMAND: S HELLO.DOC <ret>

	  It will tell you how many records are involved and how many
	  minutes and seconds it will take to send the program.  If the
	  other system is ready to receive, it starts the transfer,
	  showing how many records have been sent.  If any errors occur
	  during transmission, it shows what they are and counts them.
	  It will resend any records not correctly received at the other
	  computer.  If too many consecutive errors occur (normally set
	  at 10), the transfer is terminated.  The 'batch mode' may also
	  be used for sending:

	       B>>COMMAND: SB HELLO.*		 (sending batch mode)

	  will send all files starting with HELLO, or can send just one
	  file, or can send several non-related files in this manner:

	       B>>COMMAND: SB HELLO.DOC XDIR.COM TERM.*

	  etc.	Be sure to put a space between the various files.  You
	  can include the 'Z' option:

	       B>>COMMAND: SBZ HELLO.* IMP740.LBR I2LIB.COM

	  When the file transfer is completed it disconnects from the
	  phone line and reverts to CP/M.  This allows you to be absent
	  when the file is finished, offering an advantage when sending
	  lengthy files.

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, PAGE 2:
--------------------------------

  BYE - Disconnects the modem from the phone line, closes any file that
	  may be open and returns to CP/M.
  CAL - Displays the telephone library.

	 NOTE:	Use the phone number overlay I2NM-2 to easily change the
		numbers that are stored.  This overlay also accesses up
		to two alternate long distance dialing systems for the
		touch-tone auto-dialing modems.  You can also use an ex-
		ternal program called I2LIB to rapidly change any phone
		numbers.

  CPM - This returns to normal CP/M use, abandoning IMP.

	  CAUTION: It does not disconnect the modem from
		   the phone line, which allows intentional
		   return to CP/M temporarily.

  DIR - Enables the user to see the library of any disk without needing
	  to return to CP/M first.  Shows the amount of disk spacing
	  remaining on the logged-in default drive.  (You must log in
	  any drive you wish to write on, or to see the correct free
	  disk space remaining.)  See the LOG feature below.
  DSC - Disconnects the modem from the phone line whenever selected.
  ERA - Enables the user to erase any files from any disk without the
	  need to return to CP/M first.  Wild cards (* and ?) accepted.
  LOG - When a new disk is inserted, you can see the directory and read
	  files from it but cannot write to it without getting a "BDOS
	  ERR".  This command allows you to log in a new disk so you can
	  immediately write on it without first returning to CP/M for a
	  warm boot.  You can select drive and user number.  (This also
	  enables DIR to show the correct free disk space remaining.)
	  You can say:
			LOG <ret>  for same drive, user area, new disk
			LOG A
			LOG A:
			LOG A14    (user areas are 0-15)
			LOG A11:

  SET - Allows the user to change baudrates when desired.  If using a
	  2400 bps modem with automatic stepdown, this would rarely be
	  used.
  SPD - Sets the delay between characters and/or delay between lines in
	  the "T" mode when using ESC F upload a pre-typed file.  Since
	  most bulletin boards and TYM-SHAR systems normally use line
	  editors that require a delay after they have received a line,
	  you can add delay between characters (in increments of 4 ms.)
	  and/or enter delay between lines (in increments of 100 ms.)
	  This is preset for most systems at 2 and 200 ms.  They can be
	  changed at any time.	Current values can be checked by using
	  the  " ? " command.
  TBM - Toggle batch mode from KMD (default) to MODEM7.  The primary
	  difference is the way the file name is sent.	The older MODEM7
	  method sends each character separately, expecting the other
	  computer to echo each character.  Checksum is used to verify
	  the file name.  The KMD method sends a special 128 byte block
	  with the file name and the length of the file.  This is not
	  only far better for use with mainframe and networking systems,
	  but also informs the operator receiving the file how long it
	  will be.  (The KMD method then automatically goes to 1k mode.)
	  The chaces are excellent you will never need the MODEM7 type.
  TCC - Most modem programs originally used simple checksum verification
	  of received sectors.	Most now use Cyclic Redundancy Checking
	  which finds certain transmission errors the simple checksum
	  system might overlook.  This toggle allows the user to select
	  checksum for those systems known to not offer CRC.  When set
	  normally to CRC, the program automatically switches to check-
	  sum after trying several times to use CRC.
  TIG - Toggles the 'IGNRCTL' flag in the overlay.  This is usually set
	  to ignore incoming control characters other than those needed,
	  such as CR, LF, backspace, etc.  This minimizes unwanted char-
	  acters sometimes received in noisy conditions which can create
	  undesired effects.  Can be toggled to receive ALL incoming CTL
	  characters for the occasional use of an editor requiring them.
  TLF - If sending a file while in terminal mode (via ESC F option) most
	  mainframe computers will not want you to send a line feed.  As
	  all editors include the LF after CR, you have the option with
	  this toggle of sending or not sending a line feed.  If typing
	  manually in the "T" mode, you can get a line feed with CTL-J.
	  It is automatically included after CR with "L" or "E" modes.
  TRB - Allows the rubout char. to be changed to backspace if desired.
	  Can be set in overlay to default either way you prefer.  Set
	  to 'backspace' in distributed overlay copies.
  DEL - If copying incoming information into memory, and you decide you
	  do not want to bother saving it to disk after all, this closes
	  (and then deletes) the disk file you had opened.
  WRT - saves what you have been copying to the disk file already opened
	  for that purpose.  When returning from the "T" mode to command
	  mode, a warning is shown that you may lose what has been saved
	  unless you use WRT (write to disk).

	  NOTE: An open file is automatically written to disk
		should you use BYE or CPM commands to leave the
		program.  This prevents accidental loss of data

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, PAGE 3:
--------------------------------

  ESC E  - Returns to command modem from "T", "L", "E" modes.
  ESC F  - Sends an ASCII file to the remote terminal, X-on and X-off
	     automatically used.  Optional delays available.
  ESC L  - Will send the log-on message if one has been included in the
	     LOGON area of the overlay.  (This is intended only to send
	     a phrase of ASCII characters, not intended as a substitute
	     for "script" commands.)
  ESC N  - Disconnect the modem from the phone line.
	     (You can easily change this to whatever you like in the
	     overlay you use for your equipment.)
  ESC Q  - Sends a 300 ms. break tone.	Sometimes required by mainframe
	     computers to reset.  Used by PC Pursuit to disable the
	     '<ret> @ <ret>' disconnect command, etc.
  ESC P  - Toggles the printer on-off.	Very useful feature.  Similar to
	     normal control-P but in this case if the modem is running
	     faster than normal printer speed, the characters just back
	     into a special buffer while the printer tries to catch up.
	     Especially beneficial when using 2400 bps as few printers
	     can keep up at that speed.  Can be toggled at any time you
	     are in the "T", "L" or "E" modes.	Often used to copy items
	     from bulletin boards, etc. that are not worth permanently
	     saving on disk.

		 Note:	Some computers, such as the Commodore
			Commodore C128 cannot use the printer
			and the modem at the same time.

  ESC Z  - Clears the screen in terminal mode.	(CTL-Z normally used but
	     that goes on out the terminal to the remote system.)
  ESC Y  - Used only in terminal mode.	If ESC R is used to temporarily
	     stop copying incoming text to memory, ESC Y restarts this
	     feature.  When copying to memory, a ';' appears in the
	     first column of each line.

	   NOTE:  To open a file use:  COMMAND: T FILENAME.EXT <ret> and
		  then ESC R and ESC Y will control what is copied for
		  saving to disk.

  ESC R  - Stops the copy into memory, shuts off the ";" at start of
	     each line.  These two commands (ESC Y to start, and ESC R
	     to stop) control what is being saved.  When returning to
	     command (via ESC E), you will then be warned to save the
	     information to disk via the WRT command or it will likely
	     be lost.  (You may never use ESC R or ESC Y and just use
	     your editor on that file later to discard unwated magerial.

AUTO-DIALING AND AUTO-REDIALING:
----------------------------------------------------------------

     There are several ways to auto-dial.

	  1) from the command line
	  2) from the phone number library line

     In addition you can auto-redial from either of these lines.  Once
the number has auto-dialed and there is no answer, it will ask you if
you want it to continuously auto-redial until it does receive an answer
(or you decide to abort).

     To get the phone library, type CAL <ret> on the command line.  You
then normally just type the appropriate character at the start of the
line.  It will show the number being dialed.  You can also do this from
the main command line if you know in advance what character is used for
that particular number:

	       B>>COMMAND: CAL P <ret>

     This calls up the "P" line in the library and dials that number,
then if busy asks if you want it to continue redialing.  You can use:

	       B>>COMMAND: CAL 313-749-6569 <ret>

     and it will dial the number specified.  You can then do either of
these on the library command line, as well.  This gives a tremendous
versatility.

NOTE:	To access the alternate long distance dialing systems (up to two
	are offered), use the phone number overlay and fill in the in-
	formation regarding your access number, billing number, etc.  It
	will then show how to enter a special character ahead of each
	phone number where alternate long distance system is desired.
	This only works where touch-tone systems are in use.

AUTO-LINKING PHONE NUMBERS:
--------------------------

     If the number you want to dial is busy, you would like to have it
automatically redialed until it answers.  However, you might like to
call any of a group of numbers and be happy to take whichever one first
becomes available.  Auto-linking allows a group of numbers to be listed
and they are then continuously dialed one after the other, until one is
available.

     IMP permits from 1-32 numbers to be linked together in any manner.
There are two options:

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL A,D,R,3,Z	     1)
	   B>>COMMAND: CAL F,		     2)

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL A/D/R/3/Z	     3)
	   B>>COMMAND: CAL F/		     4)

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL A,D,A,R,A,3,A,Z   5)

	   B>>COMMAND: CAL F		     6)


	1) using a comma (,) will beep continuously when connected to
	   the first available number - touching any key stops the beep
	   and goes to terminal mode.

	2) just the one number is linked to itself and redials until
	   connected.  Beeps continuously until stopped with any key.

	3) using a slash (/) will beep only once when connected and then
	   automatically go directly to terminal mode - this is useful
	   where some mainframes such as IBM and UNIX send a logon note
	   assuming you are already able to copy as soon as connected.

	4) just the one number is linked to itself and redials until
	   connected.  Beeps only once and goes to terminal mode.

	5) illustrates how one number can be given top priority.

	6) system used previously - if connected on first try, beeps one
	   time and jumps directly to terminal mode.  If no connection,
	   asks the operator if he wants to try again or try continuous-
	   ly until a connected is made - at which time it beeps until a
	   key is depressed.

CASCADING COMMANDS:
------------------

     Several commands may be used on the same line.  Ones normally used
are:  B, D, E, K, L, Q, R, S, T, V, X and Z

     The commands have been listed previously but will be listed here
again:

	B) batch mode  (must be used at both ends if used at all)
		(usually only available modem-to-modem with operators
		present at each end.)
	D) disconnets the phone, returns to CP/M after a file transfer
	E) echo mode for conversing with a system not offering echo.
	K) used to manually request 1k transmissions on systems not
		having automatic 1k transmissions.
	L) local echo shows what you are sending if no remote echo.
	Q) quiet mode, suppresses messages on local console.
	R) receive file transfers (8-bit binary)
	S) send file transfers, also shows transfer time.
	T) terminal mode - operates computer at other end like a remote
	      terminal.  Also stands for "text mode".  When in "T" mode
	      you can copy incoming to printer or to disk, and send pre-
	      typed ASCII text files via ESC F.
	V) visual -- lets you see incoming ASCII files while being sent
		to the disk system.
	X) inhibits automatic request for 1k transmissions
	Z) disconnects the phone, returns to command mode after a file
		tranfer.

DISCUSSION OF TYPICAL PARMETERS SHOWN BY THE "?" COMMAND:
--------------------------------------------------------

     By this time, most of these parameters are self-explanatory.  They
primarily show how the options and toggles have been set.  The user can
check on any of the major parameters at any time by:

	  1) Typing ESC E to return to COMMAND: mode and
	  2) Typing  ?	to see the list of current parameters.

FUNCTION KEYS:
-------------

     There are 10 function keys which may be easily programmed with an
external file called I2FUNC.COM in just a few moments.	It makes the
changes directly to the IMP.COM file.  (There is an additional ESC L
log-on selection that is programmable in your overlay.)

     To view the contents of the function keys, type 'M' for menu while
on the command line and it will show the character currently used for
the function key intercept.  (It will be ESC unless you select another.)
You could then type that character (followed by <ret>) on the command
line and it will display the entire contents of the function keys.

	 NOTE:	ESC L gives the string of characters set
		into the 'LOGON:' area of the overlay.
		This can be used for a variety of uses.
		You can readily program that for whatever
		purpose you wish.

CHANGING THE PHONE NUMBER LIBRARY:
---------------------------------

     The phone numbers in the library may be easily changed using an
external file called I2LIB.COM.  This permits any of the 36 phone num-
bers to be changed in only a few seconds.  It works directly on the
IMP.COM file.  If extensive changes are to be made, you may prefer
to use an overlay file called I2NM-2.ASM.  This permits using your
editor to make quick and selective changes, or to substitute an entire
new library.  (You may need to add or remove things like '1-' for long
distance dialing in your area.)  That file also is used to set the
alternate long-distance dialing routines for SPRINT, MCI, TYMNET, etc.
It can also be used for changing the function key assignments.	(You
can even imbed control characters into function key assignments using
the I2NM-2.ASM file.)

INSTALLING THE PROGRAM:
----------------------

     Although this is obviously the very first thing that needs to be
done, it was saved until last for several reasons.  The most important
of these was the need to first explain what some of the options would
do when selected.

     By this time the user should have a fairly good idea what options
would work best for him.  When looking at the beginning of the program
where the these are selected, it should now be rather easy to pick the
ones that might need to be changed for a particular preference.  You may
be using a 2400 bps modem and find the overlay was set for 1200, etc.

     There are various ways to change the program to suit a specific
user.  You are offered several methods.  The "easy way" is to get the
IMP.COM file plus the appropriate overlay for your computer.  You then
edit the overlay (if needed) to suit your local needs, assemble it to
get a .HEX file then use the simple instruction and MLOAD.COM to combine
the standard IMP.COM file with your overlay.  The front end of each
overlay contains all the information on how to accomlish this.

     Generally no changes need to be made in specific overlays unless
you have some particular requirement different from others using the
same equipment.  (Such as the log-on message, for example.)

     You can also use DDT to change specific bytes without editing and
assembling.

NOTE:	Although designed with special emphasis on the auto-
	dialing and redialing capability of 1200 or 2400 bps
	modems using the Racal-Vadic or Hayes 'AT' protocol,
	the program may be used with other modems where the
	operator manually dials the number, then changes to
	terminal mode after connecting his modem.


SUMMARY
-------

     We hope this verstile program will give you hours of enjoyment and
fulfill your modem needs.  It is particularly useful with the 2400 bps
modems that have automatic stepdown.
