     I2LIB permits the user to quickly and very easily change the tele-
phone numbers in the IMP phone library.  It automatically locates the
phone library, displays it and then (after asking it if looks normal)
shows a command line:


CTL-C abort, <C>hange, <D>elete, <P>rint lib, <R>ead, <S>ave :


     To change or alter any line (such as the "F" line), you would
     then type:


CTL-C abort, <C>hange, <D>elete, <P>rint lib, <R>ead, <S>ave : CF


     The "C" would select "Change" and the "F" selects the line to
     be changed.

     This same technique would be used to delete any line that is no
     longer needed.  Using  "DH" for example leaves the  "D=" but
     clears the rest of the line.


     Whenever you change any line, you must go completely to the last
     column prior to the  <  at which time the new line is then added
     automatically and the new listing displayed.  This sets a flag
     so if you hit CTL-C to abort it will ask if you want to update
     the file or abort with no changes.  You use "S" to save the file
     to disk when finished with any changes.


USING THE PROGRAM:
-----------------

	This program works directly with the IMP object code .COM file.


     EXAMPLES:	A>I2LIB IMP.COM <ret>		(1)
		A>I2LIB B:IMP.COM <ret> (2)
		B>A:I2LIB IMP.COM <ret> (3)
		A>I2LIB IMP.COM ABC.COM (4)
		B>A:I2LIB B:IMP.COM C:ABC.COM	(5)

	1) works only with the original file, altering it
	2) the file can be on any selected disk
	3) similar to (2) but I2LIB.COM is on another disk
	4) if a 2nd file is named, it receives the changes
	5) any of the files can be on any selected disk

NOTE:	Using I2LIB.COM to alter the telephone number library is
	surprisingly simple and fast.  It does not however allow
	setting or resetting codes for SPRINT, MCI, etc.  To do
	that you would use I2NM-n.ASM
